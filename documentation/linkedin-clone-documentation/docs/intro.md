# Introduction

This documentation will cover all the steps needed to get you ready with the starter projects. Each section in the sidebar corresponds to a Youtube video. We will also additionally provide links to documentation, extra resouces, or
code snippets whenever needed.

## What is this application

LinkedIn is a very beautiful application with tons of features. And there is a lot to learn from creating a clone. Together we will discover and learn new technologies, frameworks, and work with servers, databases, ML algorithms, Cloud Services, APIs, and more.

### What can you expect?

I always try to keep things as easy and simple as possible, if you are someone who has never heard of Flutter you might find it a little hard to follow along. However, I encourage you to try, becuase hey who knows, this might spark your interest in the framework!

### What will we cover?

We will cover all of the interesting features of LinkedIn such as - Chat (with Smart replies, meetings, and other features), User connections, User feed, User posts (including some ML features), Notifications, etc.

### What will we leave out?

It is important to understand that LinkedIn is a very huge application and has taken years to build. What we will make will be a simpler clone with most of the basic features. There is a lot more to it such as analytics, UX research, extra/hidden features, advanced system design, etc. Additionally, you can always go ahead and implement more features!

## Getting Started

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) preferably v2 or above.

  - Make sure that you have installed android studio (and/or XCode) and follow all instructions for your respective OS.
  - To ensure that everything is working fine, run the command:
