# Basics

In this section, we will add video meetings feature to the previously created application. Video meetings have been an essential part of our careers, particularly since the outbreak of COVID-19.
It is one of the reasons LinkedIn decided to have inbuilt video meetings feature.

For the purpose of this, we will make use of **[Jitsi](https://meet.jit.si) - a fully encrypted, 100% open source video conferencing solution that you can use all day, every day, for free â€” with no account needed.**

## Why Jitsi?

Here is a list of all features to convince you. Jitsi is a freemium service, so it also has a paid version with more features. You can checkout [8x8](https://8x8.vc) now.
