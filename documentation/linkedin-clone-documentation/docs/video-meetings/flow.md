# Flow

Congratulations on reaching here! Let's enummerate the steps we will take for building the application together.

1. **Chat Screen** - Here we will make use of Flutter's `showBottomModalSheet()` to create a [Bottom Sheet](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/showModalBottomSheet.html) which we will call as Chat Meeting.
2. **Chat Meeting** - Now we will write the code for what happens when the instant meeting and scheduled meeting buttons are clicked.
3. **Schedule Meeting** - We will work on the `onPressed` function of this page, and add data to the DB.
4. **Common Chat Widgets** - We will work on showing the different content types (text messages, meeting links, etc.) on the chat window.
5. **Meeting Web View** - We will finally end this by working on a webview, which helps the user join the meeting and explore various features. We will also talk about the plugin jitsi_meet, and it's use case.
