This application comes with a [starter project](https://github.com/Imperial-lord/linkedin-clone) which you can clone from GitHub. Copy paste the following in your terminal.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Imperial-lord/linkedin-clone.git
```

Once done follow the next steps in the previous [section](https://imperial-lord.github.io/linkedin-clone/docs/chat-smart-replies/setup/intro) to get started. **This section does not need any specific setup steps other than those already discussed previously.**
